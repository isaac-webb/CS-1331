# Packages

## What is a package?
In java, a **package** is a group of classes/enums/things we haven't learned about yet that allows us to categorize the classes. It's really useful for organization, and it helps remove naming conflicts, and provide access protection - which basically just means we can limit which classes can use the Types in the package.

## What is the point of a package?
Lets imagine a world without packages:
* All of our code is in one folder
* We're only allowed to use a name once
* All of our classes have access to every other class in that directory
As you can probably imagine, this can get very out of hand very quickly.

## How do we create a package?
Creating a package is actually really easy! It involves 2 parts:
* Creating a folder that is the name of our package
* Creating the file in that

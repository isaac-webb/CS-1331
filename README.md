# CS 1331 Spring 2018 Section A4/GR

This repository contains William and Isaac's A4 recitation notes and materials.
Each folder, generally named for the recitation the files within were created,
contain both code examples and other Markdown documents with further notes,
explanations, etc.

## Formatting

In the contained Markdown documents, formatting is kept fairly strict, with all
code shown in `monospace` font for easy distinction. This also includes any
commands that should be executed in a terminal. They will follow formatting
specified by [docopt](http://docopt.org).

## Questions/Issues

If you should find any code examples or notes unclear or non-functional (unless
intended to be so), feel free to create an issue on this repository, and we'll
do our best to resolve it!
